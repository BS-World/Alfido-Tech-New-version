# **Alfido Tech PHP Website**

## **Overview**

The **Alfido Tech PHP Website** is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of managing internship applications and generating certificates. Built using PHP and MySQL, the website offers a simple, user-friendly interface that allows applicants to submit internship forms and download certificates upon completion. Admins can manage and review applications, as well as generate certificates.

## **Features**

- **Internship Application System:** 
  Users can submit applications through a web form. Application details are stored in a MySQL database (`internship_applications` table).
  
- **Certificate Management:** 
  The website allows for automatic generation of certificates, which can be downloaded or printed. The certificate details are stored in the `certificate` table.
  
- **Admin Dashboard:** 
  Admins have access to a dashboard for reviewing and managing internship applications. They can approve, reject, or update applications and generate certificates.
  
- **Reset Button:** 
  The reset button on forms allows users to clear all fields (name, domain, duration, certificate details, etc.) for easier form submission.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/BS-World/Alfido-Tech-New-version.git
   cd Alfido-Tech-New-version
   ```

2. **Set up the database:**
   - Import the provided SQL file into your MySQL database. This will create the necessary tables (`applications`, `internship_applications`, `certificate`).
   - Configure the database connection in `database.php` by updating the following variables:
     ```php
     $host = 'localhost'; // Database host
     $user = 'root';      // Database username
     $password = '';      // Database password
     $dbname = 'internship'; // Database name
     ```

3. **Configure your server:**
   - Ensure you have a local server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or LAMP).
   - Place the project files in the server’s root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
   
4. **Run the project:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/alfido-tech-php-website/`.

## **Usage**

### **For Users:**
- **Submit Internship Application:**
  - Fill out the application form with the required details.
  - Submit the form, and the data will be saved in the database.
  
- **Download Certificates:**
  - Upon successful internship completion, users can download certificates directly from the website.

### **For Admins:**
- **Login to Dashboard:**
  - Review applications, approve or reject them.
  - Generate certificates for approved applicants.

## **Reset Button Functionality**

The reset button in the form clears the following fields:
- Name
- Domain
- Duration
- Certificate details

## **Database Structure**

The website uses three main tables to manage data:

- `applications`: General form submissions.
- `certificate`: Stores certificate details such as the certificate number, date of issue, and recipient information.
- `internship_applications`: Manages internship applications, storing applicant details, internship domain, and duration.

## **Contributing**

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
